If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,<br>
painting you rainbows when the rains come.<br>
I'd change my orbit to banish the night,<br>
as to keep you in my nurturing light.<br>

If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,<br>
your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.<br>
Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion<br>
through time and space, our dance of devotion.<br>

If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,<br>
caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.<br>
My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,<br>
but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.<br>

If you were love's promise, then I would be time,<br>
your constant companion till stars align.<br>
And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,<br>
and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.<br>
