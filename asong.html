	<h2> Lyric</h2>
	<p>Arrested on charges of unemployment <br>
He was sitting in the witness stand<br>
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said,<br>
 free that brown eyed man<br> </p>
 
<p>Keep your job, <br>
you better free that brown eyed man<br>
Flying across the desert in a TWA<br>
I saw a woman walking across the sand<br>
</p>

<p>She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay<br>
To reach a brown eyed handsome man<br>
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man<br>
Way back in history three thousand years<br>
Back ever since the world began<br></p>


<p>There's been a whole lot of good women shedding tears<br>
For a brown eyed handsome man<br>
A lot of trouble was a brown eyed handsome man<br>
Well, the beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind<br>
Between a doctor and a lawyer man<br>
Her mother told her, darling, go out and find yourself<br>
A brown eyedâ€¦ </p>
